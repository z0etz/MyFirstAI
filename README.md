# Story Tour

I started Story Tour as my final Building AI course project and aim to keep developing it as I learn more about programming and AI. 

As of Juni 1st 2024 the app is available as an Android prototype with pre-defined locations. If you ever find yourself near Biomedicum in Solna, Sweden, feel free to download the APK from this repository and try it out!


## Summary

Story Tour lets you explore any new location via enchanting stories, where you are the main character! In every adventure a new story unfolds, as you walk to different point of interests and make choices of what you would like to do next.


## Background

I have previously created treasure hunts and adventures where users need to find details in the real world and use those to solve different puzzles, some examples can be seen at: [Zonventure](https://zonventure.com/) and T.I.M.O.s](https://timos.se/). Story Tour is an experiment to explore how AI can be utilized to to generate interesting and interactive adventures.


## How is it used?

Describe the process of using the solution. In what kind situations is the solution needed (environment, time, etc.)? Who are the users, what kinds of needs should be taken into account?

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
